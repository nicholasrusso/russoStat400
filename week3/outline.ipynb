    "While we are able to __estimate__ these parameters, we do not know the true parameters, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. Remember that these parameters were estimated from a __sample of the population__. To validate these parameters, we can use __confidence intervals__. A confidence interval provides a way \n",

    "These values are normally distributed and the mean is centered at $\\mu_y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i$. Notice how each y response value is uniquely defined by the distance to the regression line or by the residuals; these are also called __errors ($\\varepsilon$)__. Now, our updated linear model is now $y_i =  \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\varepsilon_i$. For each explanatory variable, the error values are independent and normally distributed with a mean of 0.\n",
