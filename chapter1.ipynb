Let's imagine that you have just collected some data points and want to start visualizing your results.  A great way to quickly visualize our data would be through scatterplots. Scatterplots are extremely important to linear regression. Scatterplots are used to identify patterns or outliers, explore relationships, and find clusters.

The explanantory variable or independent variable is the variable that __causes or explains the outcome__ of the response variable; this will be plotted on the X axis.

    "Correlation is denoted as r and measures both strength and direction (or association) between two variables regardless if one is an explantory or response variable. The correlation between two variables is given as a single number between -1 and 1. Strength is measured by seeing how close the correlation is to -1 or 1. So, a correlation score of 0.9 or -0.8 would imply an extremely strong relationship while a score of -0.5 or 0.1 would imply a weak relationship. To measure direction, we check if the correlation score is greater than or less than 0. When r > 0, there is a positive association. When r < 0, there is a negative association. Overall, if the correlation score is closer to 1, it is consider positive correlation. If the correlation score is closer to -1, it is consider negative correlation. This score is extremely important because if we square the correlation, it can __explain the variability that one variable causes in another__. For example, if create a linear model explaining the effects of x on y and the correlation between them is -0.6 then 36% of the variability in y is explained by x."

In this example, there is just $t$ so we do not have to worry about holding other variables constant. So, we know $b_1 = \\frac{v}{4}$ from our translation table above and we know the value of $b_1$. Now, when we mulitply $b_1$ by 4, we have our estimate of speed of sound. 341.82 m/s is only off by roughly 1.18 m/s!"
