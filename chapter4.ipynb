    "The coefficients of a multiple linear regression model, $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ... \\beta_n$, are sometimes called _partial regression coefficients_ because each coefficient is responsible for part of the effect on our response variable. It is important to note that these coefficients explain their effect on y when holding all other variables constant. This is why the number of bedrooms had a negative effect on the housing price. \n",
    " <img src='images/chapter4/bed_houses.png'>\n",
    "If we keep the living area constant but continually increase the number of bedrooms, the house would loose value because there wouldn't be any room for our spaces like a kitchen or a dining room. Conversly, if we keep the number of bedrooms constant but increase the living area the price increases.\n",
    "<img src='images/chapter4/size_house.png'>\n",
    "Intuitively, this makes sense because as the home becomes larger and the number of bedrooms is constant, there is more space for the homeowners. \n",

    "$\\beta_0$: When the living area and number of bedrooms are zero, the price of a house is $59496.23 on average.\n",

    "$\\beta_1$: Holding the number of bedrooms constant, the price of a house increases by $136, on average, for each square foot increase.\n",

    "#### Coefficient of Determination (R-squared)\n",
    "A useful metric in multiple linear regression is the Coefficient of Determination or $R^2$. $R^2$ measures the proportion of variability in the response variable caused by the explanatory variables. So, $R^2$ values of 0 indicate that the response variable can not be predicted using the explanatory variables. While an $R^2$ value of 1 indicates that the response variable can be predicted from the explanatory variables without error; all of our points would lie on the regression line. Any value between zero and one indicate the proporation of variability in the response variable \"explained\" by the explanatory variables. The Coefficient of Determination can be calculated with the following formula:\n",
    "$$R^2 = \\frac{\\Sigma{(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y}})^2}{\\Sigma{(y_i - \\bar{y}})^2}$$\n",
