The only difference is that you are comparing the affects of two or more explanatory variables on a response variable. Let's take a look the multiple linear regression model to solidify this idea:\n",

    "### Estimating Parameters\n",
    "To estimate our parameters, $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ... \\beta_n$, we will use least squares regression. The equation is almost identical to simple linear regression but it accounts for the new parameters. Remember, in least-squares regression, the aim is to minimize the _sum of squared errors_:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\textrm{errors}_i)^2 &= \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat y_i)^2 \\\\\n",
    "&= \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (b_0 + b_1 x_i + b_1 x_i ))^2\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we take the derivative of the equation above, with respect to $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ... \\beta_n$, set them equal to zero, and then solve for $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ... \\beta_n$. While it's good to know the underlining math behind this, we will use SALMON to calculate these parameters."

    "### Interpreting Multiple Linear Regression Models\n",
    "The coefficients of a multiple linear regression model, $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ... \\beta_n$, are sometimes called _partial regression coefficients_ because each coefficient is responsible for part of the effect on our response variable. It is important to note that these coefficients explain their effect on y when holding all other variables constant. This is why the number of bedrooms had a negative effect on the housing price. \n",
    " <img src='images/chapter4/bed_houses.png'>\n",
    "If we keep the living area constant but continually increase the number of bedrooms, the house would loose value because there wouldn't be any room for our spaces like a kitchen or a dining room. Conversly, if we keep the number of bedrooms constant but increase the living area the price increases.\n",
    "<img src='images/chapter4/size_house.png'>\n",
    "Intuitively, this makes sense because as the home becomes larger and the number of bedrooms is constant, there is more space for the homeowners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, we can interpret this model in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta_1$: Holding the number of bedrooms constant, the price of a house increases by \\$136 for each single unit increase of living area.\n",
    "\n",
